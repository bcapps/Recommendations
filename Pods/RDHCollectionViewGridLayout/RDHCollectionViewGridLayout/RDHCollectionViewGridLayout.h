 * Defines the size of the unconstrained dimension of the items. Simply, for vertical layouts this is the height of the items, and for horizontal layouts this is the width of the items.
 * Setting this value to 0 will make layout set the dimension to the average of the other dimenion on the same line. This is due to the layout taking account of dirty pixels, adding these extra pixels in the first X items on the line.
 * For example, if using a vertical scrollDirection and a lineItemCount of 5 when the collectionView has a width of 104, the first 4 items on every line will have a width of 21, and the last 20 (21 + 21 + 21 + 21 + 20 = 104), so the height of the lines would be 21 (20.8 rounded).
 *
 * The default value of this property is 0.

Best case is that the useable width is exactly divisible by lineItemCount, worse case is that `(useable width) mod lineItemCount = (lineItemCount - 1)` and that the first `(lineItemCount - 1)` items are 1 pixel bigger.
